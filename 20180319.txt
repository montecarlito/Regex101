PID vs PPID

/sbin/init #PID 1 & PPID 2

Everything in Userland is segregated by its own memory allocations, each bidding for action by the kernel in system calls

Linux is a monolithic kernel

ps -elf | grep init
ps -elf | grep kthread

ps -aux

Not all orphans are daemons, but all daemons are orphans

STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR

daemons route to dev/null by default
--typically noted by a "d" at the end of the filename (not a ".d" which calls a dir)
--a lot of them run in the background
--orphaned programs/services running in the background 

**Fork bomb

cron -e

mknod mypipe p
mkfifo

**fstab vs sbin/init

use systemctl for everything in systemd
